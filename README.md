**Illuminate your focus, dim the distractions.**

## Features

CodeGlow helps you focus on what matters by intelligently dimming inactive regions of your code. Like a spotlight on your active code block, it keeps you in the zone while maintaining context awareness.

### Smart Focus Detection

- **Paragraph Mode**: Automatically detects and highlights text blocks between blank lines
- **Symbol Mode**: Uses VS Code's language server to focus on semantic blocks (functions, classes, etc.)
- **Smooth Transitions**: Seamlessly updates as you move through your code
- **Smart Scroll Handling**: Temporarily removes dimming while scrolling for better readability

### Customizable Experience

- **Adjustable Dimming**: Fine-tune the opacity of inactive regions (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Buffer Control**: Set how many lines to process above and below the visible area
- **Multiple Detection Modes**: Choose between paragraph-based or symbol-based detection
- **Scroll Behavior**: Configure how the extension handles scrolling and transitions
- **Performance Optimized**: Only processes visible code, making it efficient even with large files

## Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on macOS)
3. Type `ext install wescottsharples.codeglow`
4. Press Enter

## Usage

1. Open any code file
2. Move your cursor to a code block
3. The current block stays at full opacity while surrounding code is dimmed
4. Toggle the effect with:
   - Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`): "CodeGlow: Toggle Effect"
   - Or set up your own keyboard shortcut

## Configuration

CodeGlow can be customized through VS Code's settings:

\`\`\`jsonc
{
  // Opacity level for dimmed text (0.0 to 1.0)
  "codeglow.dimOpacity": 0.3,

  // Use paragraph mode (text between blank lines)
  "codeglow.paragraphMode": true,

  // Choose focus detection method
  "codeglow.blockDetection": "paragraph", // or "documentSymbols"

  // Number of buffer lines to process
  "codeglow.bufferLines": 50,

  // Enable/disable dimming removal while scrolling
  "codeglow.disableWhileScrolling": true,

  // Delay before reapplying dimming after scrolling (ms)
  "codeglow.scrollDebounceDelay": 250,

  // Enable debug logging
  "codeglow.enableLogging": false
}
\`\`\`

## Performance

CodeGlow is designed to be lightweight and efficient:
- Only processes visible code
- Minimal CPU usage
- Low memory footprint
- Optimized for large files
- Smart scroll handling to maintain performance
